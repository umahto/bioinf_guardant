Possible Use Cases to Test

In terms of error handling, I considered the following possibilities:
1. Invalid options
2. Incorrect/corrupted/inaccessible input file
3. Invalid characters (non-letters)
4. Empty input list

Biologically relevant use cases include the following:
1. Calculating the frequency of GC content which can be used to find replication origins.
2. Finding the longest multiple subsequence(s)
3. Finding the most frequent k-mer(s) in a given DNA/RNA string
4. With modification, can be use to find the most frequent words with mismatches and reverse complements from input string and similarly could be used as a starting point to find motifs.
5. Can be used in genome assembly and string reconstruction.
