Possible Use Cases to Test

In terms of error handling, I considered the following possibilities:
1. Invalid options (n > 10)
2. Incorrect/corrupted/inaccessible input file
3. Invalid characters (non-letters) for the symbols
4. Empty input list

Biologically relevant use cases include the following:
1. All possible kmer combinations from a set of symbols - used in other bioinformatics algorithms (HMM)
2. With modification, can be used to get all possible nucleotide sequences of length n.
3. With modification, can be used to get all possible protein sequences of length n.
