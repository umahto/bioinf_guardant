Possible Use Cases to Test

In terms of error handling, I considered the following possibilities:
1. Invalid options
2. Incorrect/corrupted/inaccessible input file
3. Invalid characters (non-letters)
4. Empty input list

Basic use cases include the following:
1. Parse through VCF files.
2. Get all variants from the input sequences along with their chromosome-positions.
3. Can calculate how many different variants for each chromosome-position present in the input files. Can also split across genomic regions.
