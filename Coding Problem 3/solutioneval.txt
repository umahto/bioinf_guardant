Evaluation of implementation

Key Strengths
1. Doesn't use an external or 3rd party library to parse VCF files.
2. Time and space complexity are linear.

Key Weaknesses
1. Needs to be updated on its own to adhere to VCF file specifications since it is not using a 3rd party.
2. Doesn't consider quality of input sequences for the VCF file.
